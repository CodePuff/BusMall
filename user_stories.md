#BusMall User Stories

###BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

##As the Focus Group Participant:
	1. I want to navigate through an app that is enjoyable and easy to use.  I want to know what my choices are, where I need to click and any other clear instructions so I'm not wondering what I need to do. 
	2. I want to be a be able to comfortably view 3 products side-by-side-by-side and choose which product I would most likely want to purchase.  
	3. I want to know when to stop viewing the products and making a selection. 
	4. I want to see what the results of the survey are when I'm done so that I can confirm what I have chosen. 
	5. I want to know that my participation and data from the survey are making an actual impact so that BusMall can tailor their products to my likes and interests.

##As the Marketing Research Team / BusMall:
	1. I want an app that allows the users in the focus group to select from three clearly marked images, side-by-side-by-side and non-repeating back-to-back. 
	2. I don't want the users to see their results until after they make a selection 25 times so that the their answers are not tainted.  
	3. I want to see a report of the total number of clicks and the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.
	4. I want to use the information so that our marketing content can be cost effective and BusMall features only the items in its catalog that are tailored to our audience that are most likely to sell.  
	
##As the Developer:
	1. I want to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (non repeating back-to-back three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side).
	2. I want to have the focus group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would most likely purchase, and then store, calculate and visually display the resulting data.
	3. I want to keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, not allowing any results to be shown to the focus group members until there have been a total of 25 selections made.
	4. I want to tabulate the data and provide a report to the marketing research team to include the total number of clicks and the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.  I need to keep track of how many times each image was displayed and do the calculations to create this report.  
	5. I want the look and feel of the app to be appealing, fun and informative for the focus group participants and marketing team members.
